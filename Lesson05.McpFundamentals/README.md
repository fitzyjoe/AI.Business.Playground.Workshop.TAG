## Building a Property Records MCP Server

Lesson05 introduces the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** by building a small, read-only MCP server in C#.

The server exposes property-record lookup capabilities that can be discovered and invoked by any compatible MCP client.

Unlike the previous lessons, this project does **not** call an LLM.

The goal is to first understand and test the MCP server independently. A later lesson will connect an LLM to the server and allow the model to select and invoke MCP tools.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you should understand:

- what MCP is;
- the roles of an MCP host, client, and server;
- what an MCP tool is;
- how MCP tools differ from ordinary C# methods;
- how to build an MCP server using the C# MCP SDK;
- how tool input and output schemas are generated from C# types;
- how to expose business services through MCP;
- how dependency injection works with MCP tools;
- how to return structured tool results;
- the difference between invalid input and a valid "not found" result;
- why standard output must be reserved for the MCP protocol when using stdio;
- how to test an MCP server using MCP Inspector.

## Architecture

The Lesson05 architecture is:

```text
MCP Inspector
      ↓
MCP Client Connection
      ↓
Lesson05.McpFundamentals
      ↓
PropertyTools
      ↓
IPropertyRepository
      ↓
InMemoryPropertyRepository
      ↓
properties.json (loaded once)
```

The repository reads the JSON sample data when the singleton repository is first constructed and keeps the deserialized records in memory. Individual MCP tool calls do not reread the file.

The MCP Inspector acts as the client while developing and testing the server.

In a later lesson, the Inspector will be replaced by an AI-enabled application.

## MCP Roles

### MCP Host

The host is the application that wants to use MCP capabilities.

Examples might eventually include:

- an AI chat application;
- an IDE;
- an agent;
- a desktop application.

For this lesson, the MCP Inspector effectively plays the host role.

### MCP Client

An MCP client manages the connection between a host and an MCP server.

It can:

- initialize the connection;
- discover tools;
- inspect tool schemas;
- invoke tools;
- receive tool results.

### MCP Server

The MCP server exposes capabilities using the MCP standard.

Lesson05 is an MCP server.

It exposes two property-related tools.

## Tools

Lesson05 exposes two read-only MCP tools.

### `lookup_property_by_parcel`

Looks up one property using an exact parcel number.

Example input:

```json
{
  "parcelNumber": "0304-12-0042"
}
```

Example successful result:

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "property": {
    "parcelNumber": "0304-12-0042",
    "ownerName": "ABC Commercial Holdings LLC",
    "propertyAddress": "1200 Main Street, McLean, VA 22101",
    "jurisdiction": "Fairfax County, Virginia",
    "taxYear": 2026,
    "assessedValue": 8450000
  }
}
```

A parcel that does not exist is still a valid tool request.

Example:

```json
{
  "found": false,
  "property": null
}
```

"Not found" is a normal business result rather than a server failure.

### `search_properties_by_owner`

Searches properties using all or part of an owner's name.

Example input:

```json
{
  "ownerName": "ABC Commercial",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

Example result:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "properties": [
    {
      "parcelNumber": "0304-12-0042",
      "ownerName": "ABC Commercial Holdings LLC",
      "propertyAddress": "1200 Main Street, McLean, VA 22101",
      "jurisdiction": "Fairfax County, Virginia",
      "taxYear": 2026,
      "assessedValue": 8450000
    },
    {
      "parcelNumber": "0304-12-0043",
      "ownerName": "ABC Commercial Holdings LLC",
      "propertyAddress": "1210 Main Street, McLean, VA 22101",
      "jurisdiction": "Fairfax County, Virginia",
      "taxYear": 2026,
      "assessedValue": 5275000
    }
  ]
}
```

```

The tool class depends on `IPropertyRepository`, not directly on the in-memory implementation.

This means the storage implementation could later be replaced by:

- SQL Server;
- Azure SQL;
- an internal REST API;
- another business data source.

The MCP tool contract would not need to change.

## Sample Property Data

`Features/Properties/properties.json` contains 50 synthetic commercial-property records used by this lesson and by the later lessons that launch the Lesson05 MCP server.

Some example parcel numbers include the following:

```text
0304-12-0042
0304-12-0043
0752-03-0188
```

Additional records provide repeated owners and repeated street names so search tools have useful multi-result cases. For example, `Reston Tech Holdings LLC` owns five sample properties on `Innovation Drive`.

`Lesson05.McpFundamentals.csproj` copies the JSON file into the build and publish output while preserving its relative path. `InMemoryPropertyRepository` resolves the file from `AppContext.BaseDirectory`, rather than assuming that the process was started from a particular working directory.

The repository is still appropriately called "in-memory" because the JSON file is only the seed data source. Once loaded, parcel and owner searches operate against the in-memory collection.

## Running the Server

Build the project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

The compiled executable will be located under:

```text
bin/Debug/net10.0/
```

The copied property data is located under:

```text
bin/Debug/net10.0/Features/Properties/properties.json
```

The MCP server uses **standard input/output transport**.

Normally, you do not launch it directly for testing. Instead, an MCP client such as MCP Inspector launches the process and communicates with it.

## MCP Inspector

MCP Inspector is used to test the server without involving an LLM.

It serves a role similar to Postman or curl for an HTTP API.

It can:

- connect to the server;
- list tools;
- inspect generated schemas;
- execute tool calls;
- inspect structured results.

Launch the Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  "./bin/Debug/net10.0/Lesson05.McpFundamentals"
```

If you modify the C# project or `properties.json`, remember:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Then disconnect and reconnect the Inspector.

The Inspector launches the compiled executable. It does not automatically rebuild the project or recopy changed sample data.

## Inspecting Tool Definitions

The Inspector CLI can return the full tool definitions:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli \
  "./bin/Debug/net10.0/Lesson05.McpFundamentals" \
  --method tools/list
```

The result includes:

- tool name;
- title;
- description;
- input schema;
- output schema;
- tool annotations.

For example, the parcel lookup input schema is generated automatically from the C# method signature:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "parcelNumber": {
      "description": "The exact parcel number, including punctuation. Example: 0304-12-0042.",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "parcelNumber"
  ]
}
```

The output schema is generated from `PropertyLookupResult` and `PropertyRecord`.

## Structured Tool Results

The tools use:

```csharp
UseStructuredContent = true
```

This causes MCP to advertise an output schema derived from the C# return type.

For example:

```csharp
public sealed record PropertyLookupResult(
    bool Found,
    PropertyRecord? Property);
```

produces a structured MCP result rather than a manually formatted string.

This is similar to Lesson04, where C# types were used to define structured LLM output.

The difference is:

```text
Lesson04
C# type
    ↓
JSON Schema
    ↓
Constrains LLM output

Lesson05
C# method + return type
    ↓
MCP input/output schemas
    ↓
Defines tool contract
```

## Nullable vs Optional Properties

A useful issue encountered while building this lesson involves nullable properties.

Consider:

```csharp
public sealed record PropertyLookupResult(
    bool Found,
    PropertyRecord? Property);
```

The generated MCP schema may say:

```json
{
  "required": [
    "found",
    "property"
  ]
}
```

while also allowing:

```json
"property": null
```

This means:

```text
property is required
but
property's value may be null
```

That is different from making the property optional.

A not-found result should therefore look like:

```json
{
  "found": false,
  "property": null
}
```

rather than:

```json
{
  "found": false
}
```

Serializer configuration must be consistent with the advertised MCP schema.

## Standard Input/Output Transport

This server uses stdio transport.

The streams have specific purposes:

```text
stdin
    MCP requests sent to the server

stdout
    MCP protocol responses

stderr
    logging and diagnostics
```

Because stdout carries MCP protocol messages, do not use:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Server started");
```

inside the server.

Writing arbitrary text to stdout can corrupt the MCP protocol stream.

Use `ILogger` instead.

The application configures logging so that logs are written to stderr.

## Dependency Injection

`PropertyTools` receives the repository through dependency injection:

```csharp
public sealed class PropertyTools(
    IPropertyRepository _propertyRepository)
```

The repository is registered in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<
    IPropertyRepository,
    InMemoryPropertyRepository>();
```

The first time the singleton repository is constructed, it loads `properties.json`. The MCP SDK creates the tool class and resolves its dependencies from the service container.

This keeps MCP concerns separate from business and data-access concerns.

## Read-Only Tools

The lesson intentionally begins with read-only tools.

The MCP attributes identify these tools as read-only:

```csharp
ReadOnly = true
```

Read-only capabilities are a safer starting point than tools that:

- modify database records;
- send emails;
- create payments;
- delete data;
- trigger workflows.

Write operations and approval boundaries will be introduced later in the course.

## Important Distinction: MCP Is Not the LLM

Lesson05 contains no LLM.

The flow is currently:

```text
You
 ↓
MCP Inspector
 ↓
MCP Server
 ↓
Property Repository
```

The MCP server does not decide which tool should be called.

It simply:

- advertises available capabilities;
- defines their schemas;
- executes valid tool requests;
- returns results.

A later lesson will introduce an LLM that can decide which MCP tool to invoke.
